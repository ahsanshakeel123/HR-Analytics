# Employee Retention Funnel Analysis for Enterprise HR

## Executive Summary

Employee attrition has been higher than expected, increasing hiring costs and productivity loss. Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I analyzed employee lifecycle data and built a dashboard to track attrition across departments, roles, and tenure.

The analysis revealed that the greatest retention opportunities lie with early-tenure employees, particularly in lower compensation bands and specific roles. To reduce attrition and improve retention, I recommend:
- Implement structured 30–60–90 day onboarding and early feedback to reduce first-year attrition.
- Provide managers with role-level attrition dashboards to identify and address retention risks early.
- Review pay competitiveness and define clear growth paths for roles with consistently high turnover.

## Business Problem
Employee retention is critical for this organization since attrition directly impacts hiring costs, productivity, and business continuity. HR and leadership stakeholders have noticed that turnover is higher than expected, especially among early-tenure employees and certain roles. How can we determine where employees are most at risk of leaving and implement targeted initiatives to improve engagement and retention?

# Methodology:

1. SQL queries to extract, clean, and transform employee-level data from the HR database.

2. A dashboard in Power BI that tracks attrition, tenure, satisfaction, and performance across departments and roles.

3. A Python-based analysis to identify high-risk employee segments and simulate the impact of retention initiatives.

# Skills:

SQL: CTEs, Joins, Case, Aggregate functions, Data cleaning and transformation

Power BI: DAX, Writing functions, ETL, Calculated columns, Data visualization, Data modeling

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Writing functions, Employee segmentation, Predictive analysis, Statistics







## Recommendations
Because the greatest business impact comes from improving early-stage employee engagement and retention, the following actions are recommended:

- Strengthen onboarding and first-year engagement programs
- Equip managers with role-level attrition insights
- Review compensation and career progression for high-risk roles
- Use the dashboard as an ongoing self-service monitoring tool

These initiatives address the largest attrition drivers, improve workforce stability, and continue to save the analytics team time through reduced reporting requests.

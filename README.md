# HR Analytics Dashboard – Workforce Attrition & Performance Insights

## Project Overview
Creating an HR analytics dashboard gives HR leaders and business stakeholders visibility into the employee lifecycle funnel, both overall and across departments, job roles, and demographic segments. By democratizing access to workforce data, stakeholders are now able to self-serve insights, reducing dependency on ad-hoc reporting and allowing the analytics team to focus on higher-impact initiatives.

This project analyzes employee attrition, job satisfaction, compensation, and tenure trends using Power BI and Python-based modeling to identify the highest-impact levers for improving retention.

## Business Problem
Employee attrition is costly and often preventable. HR teams frequently struggle with limited visibility into attrition drivers, reactive retention strategies, and a high volume of manual reporting requests.

This analysis focuses on:
- Identifying where employee fallout occurs in the lifecycle
- Understanding which factors most strongly influence attrition
- Quantifying the business impact of incremental improvements

---

## Data Source
- Dataset: HR_Analytics.csv
- Level: Employee-level data
- Key fields include attrition, job role, department, salary, tenure, satisfaction, and performance ratings

---

## Dashboard Overview (Power BI)
The Power BI dashboard enables:
- Attrition analysis by department, role, salary slab, and tenure
- Compensation and satisfaction comparisons
- Interactive filtering for leadership and HR partners

A dashboard preview is included in this repository.

## Business Impact
Creating a centralized HR dashboard democratized workforce data access across HR and leadership teams, enabling self-service analytics and reducing ad-hoc reporting by an estimated 4–6 hours per week.

The analysis revealed that nearly 50% of employee attrition occurs within the first few years of employment, with early-tenure employees and specific job roles representing the highest risk. Modeling results indicate that even a 1% improvement in employee engagement and retention can generate meaningful cost savings by reducing hiring, onboarding, and productivity loss.

These insights allow HR leaders to prioritize retention initiatives based on measurable ROI rather than intuition.

## Key Insights
- Early-tenure employees drive the majority of attrition
- Lower compensation bands correlate with higher turnover
- Engagement and satisfaction compound retention outcomes
- Small improvements lead to outsized long-term savings

---

## Recommendations
Because the greatest business impact comes from improving early-stage employee engagement and retention, the following actions are recommended:

- Strengthen onboarding and first-year engagement programs
- Equip managers with role-level attrition insights
- Review compensation and career progression for high-risk roles
- Use the dashboard as an ongoing self-service monitoring tool

These initiatives address the largest attrition drivers, improve workforce stability, and continue to save the analytics team time through reduced reporting requests.
